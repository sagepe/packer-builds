# Packer Builds

Packer recipes for base Linux builds. Primarily used for building my [Vagrant boxes](https://app.vagrantup.com/sagepe).

It's useful sometimes to be in control of these, rather than relying on other sources.

These builds currently target VirtualBox.

The top-level Makefile will build them all by default.
